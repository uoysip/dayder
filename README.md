# Marsto

Marsto is a web app that adapts [Dayder](https://github.com/trishume/dayder) to find positive market correlations in over 12,000,000+ stock and ETF time-series records. It uses a [custom binary serialization method](https://github.com/uoysip/marsto/blob/master/format.md) to convert CSV files containing stocks and ETFs into a file format that is magnitudes smaller and faster than the original. The datasets used for this instance of the web app was provided by Boris Marjanovic and can be found [on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/borismarjanovic/price-volume-data-for-all-us-stocks-etfs).
